To find out exactly how mental health affects physical health, Live Science asked the experts to explain the science behind this profound link.

Mental health is no longer something we are encouraged to keep quiet about. If the COVID-19pandemichas taught us anything about being stuck indoors, it’s that the mental health implications of isolation can have a knock-on effect on your physical health too.

Maybe you have been living withmental healthissues for as long as you can remember, or perhaps have recently found yourself suffering as a result of the pandemic and struggling to lift your mood. Whether you’ve been affected by financial issues or social media pressure, day-to-day tasks can become insurmountable on the most difficult days. For some people, keeping on top of their physical health during these difficult times can seem impossible.

But boosting your physical health as a way to improve your mental health can be as simple as going out for a brisk walk to break up your day, taking up a new skill like cooking, or even discovering thepower of yoga. Taking time to quiet the mind and practice on the mat can do wonders for conditions such as anxiety and depression, especially when you get those endorphins going.

In this article, Rhian Stephenson, a registered nutritionist, naturopath and founder ofARTAHdiscusses how our mental and physical health is connected, how poor mental health can affect our bodies and provides tips on how to improve your mental health.

Stephenson told Live Science, "Think of your health as a system of interconnected biological networks rather than isolated silos." If you ever have days when you just want to stay in bed and shut yourself away from the world this is when mental health issues can impact your physical health.

A recent survey byThe Conversationfound that, as a result of the pandemic, Americans are eight times more likely to suffer from serious mental distress compared to a few years ago.

Sarie Taylor who is a psychotherapist and coach explained: "It is impossible to separate our mind and our bodies as they are intrinsically linked, they speak to each other and work in harmony.

"This means that if we are overwhelmed, stressed, or overthinking in any way then our mind will alert our bodies to that fact, and the body will do its best to alert us and encourage us to pay attention to what is going on. This can be exhausting for both the mind and the body, and so we will feel that in a physical as well as on a mental level." Taylor added.

If your head isn’t in the right space then it can be a downward spiral from there. And if you do find yourself wanting to shut yourself away from the world, your diet can be impacted, too. You might be totally off your food or have no motivation to cook. Mental health issues such as anxiety or depression can make you feel numb and want to close off from the outside world.

Our bodies and minds are profoundly interconnected, so if you suffer from mental health issues then your body will also feel the impact in more ways than one - and vice versa. As an example, when an athlete suffers from a sports injury, their mental health might be impacted by the inability to play or practice their usual daily routine.

"Our mental health will also affect how we feel in our body in more obvious ways,"  explained Stephenson. "Sleep health, motivation and energy for exercise, response to exercise and appetite can all be positively and negatively impacted by our emotional state. For example, studies have shown that emotional states such as anxiety and depression can increaseinsulin resistance, which over time can lead to not only diabetes but increase the risk for other chronic illnesses that are associated with insulin dysregulation."

Our emotional condition is often mirrored by our immune response. Stephenson continued, "…depressed individuals are more likely to have depressed immune activity. Equally, depression is linked to an increased incidence of certain chronic and long-term illnesses, likediabetes, stroke, and heart attack. On the flip side, practices like gratitude, meditation, and even increasing happiness have a direct effect on the immune system, cortisol and other regulatory hormones."

When we are stressed, it causes inflammation in the body, and so you may find that if you have vulnerable areas or injuries, this may be where you feel it most. Taylor told Live Science "Some of the most obvious beginnings of stress are that we may notice tension in the body in the way we sit and hold ourselves, but this is not set in stone, it will be unique to everyone. Every physical response in the body is telling us something, we just need to listen."

Ever wondered why you hold so much tension in your shoulders, neck, head and lower back, without even setting foot in the gym? This is best described as muscular tension and it occurs because of a reflex reaction to stress taking its toll on your body. According to a study by theAmerican Psychological Association, both tension-type headaches and migraine headaches are associated with chronic muscle tension in the shoulders, neck and head. Musculoskeletal pain in the low back and upper extremities has also been linked to stress, especially stress at work. While massage can get rid ofmuscle knots, and other physical symptoms, it will only offer temporary relief.

"If we are too far ahead of ourselves and worrying about the 'what ifs', the most primal part of the brain, the part that looks out for any warning signs and thoughts, will actually act accordingly as though the danger and threat are currently happening.

This area of the brain also regulates the heart rate and temperature of the body and so on, which is why you could find your heart racing and your temperature changing based on your thoughts alone. As stress and worry cause inflammation in the body, this may, in turn, create pain in vulnerable areas of the body that you may struggle with in general even when you are not stressed. This pain can be a fantastic warning sign that your stress is taking its toll on your body, and that you need to prioritize yourself and your wellbeing." Taylor added.

A study by theMayo Clinicexplains some of the key mental health markers to look out for:

"When it comes to mental health there are a lot of factors within your control that you can modify to improve your mental health," said Stephenson.

If you are struggling with your mental health, always seek medical advice and speak to a qualified professional. If you don't feel able to get professional help, you should always try to talk tosomeoneto let them know you are struggling.

Stress symptoms may be affecting your health, even though you might not know it. You may blame sickness for that annoying headache, your sleeping troubles, feeling unwell or your lack of focus at work. But stress may really be the cause.

Stress symptoms can affect your body, your thoughts and feelings, and your behavior. Knowing common stress symptoms can help you manage them. Stress that's not dealt with can lead to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, obesity and diabetes.

If you have stress symptoms, taking steps to manage your stress can have many health benefits. Check out many possible stress management tips. For example:

Aim to find active ways to manage your stress. Idle ways to manage stress that don't get you moving may seem relaxing. But they may make your stress go up over time. Examples are watching television, going on the internet or playing video games.

If you're not sure if stress is the cause, or if you've taken steps to control your stress but you keep having symptoms, see your health care provider. Your health care provider may want to check for other potential causes. Or think about seeing a counselor or therapist, who can help you find the sources of your stress and learn new coping tools. And if you are concerned about harming yourself, call 911 or a suicide hotline.

Also, get emergency help right away if you have chest pain, especially if you also have shortness of breath; jaw, back, shoulder or arm pain; sweating; dizziness; or nausea. These may be warning signs of a heart attack and not simply stress symptoms.

Depression and anxiety symptoms often improve with exercise. Here are some realistic tips to help you get started and stay motivated.

When you have depression or anxiety, exercise often seems like the last thing you want to do. But once you get started and keep going, exercise can make a big difference.

Exercise helps prevent and improve many health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis. Research on depression, anxiety and exercise shows that the mental health and physical benefits of exercise also can help mood get better and lessen anxiety.

The links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear. But working out and other forms of physical activity can ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise also may help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better.

Regular exercise may help ease depression and anxiety by:

Regular exercise has many mental health and emotional benefits too. It can help you:

Some research shows that physical activity such as regular walking — not just formal exercise programs — may help mood improve. Physical activity and exercise are not the same thing, but both are good for your health.

The word "exercise" may make you think of running laps around the gym. But exercise includes a wide range of activities that boost your activity level to help you feel better.

Certainly running, lifting weights, playing basketball and other fitness activities that get your heart pumping can help. But so can physical activity such as gardening, washing your car, walking around the block or doing other less intense activities. Any physical activity that gets you off the couch and moving can boost your mood.

You don't have to do all your exercise or other physical activity at one time. Broaden how you think of exercise. Find ways to add small amounts of physical activity throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park a little farther away from work to fit in a short walk. Or if you live close to your job, consider biking to work.

For most healthy adults, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services exercise guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. Or get at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week. You also can get an equal mix of the two types.

Aim to exercise most days of the week. But even small amounts of physical activity can be helpful. Being active for short periods of time, such as 10 to 15 minutes at a time, throughout the day can add up and have health benefits.

Regular exercise may improve depression or anxiety symptoms enough to make a big difference. That big difference can help kick-start further improvements. The mental health benefits of exercise and physical activity may last only if you stick with them over the long term. That's another good reason to find activities that you enjoy.

Starting and sticking with an exercise routine or regular physical activity can be a challenge. These steps can help:

Check with your doctor or other healthcare professional before starting a new exercise program to make sure it's safe for you. Talk about which activities, how much exercise and what intensity level is OK for you. Your healthcare professional can consider any medicines you take and your health conditions. You also can get helpful advice about getting started and staying on track.

If you exercise regularly but depression or anxiety symptoms still affect your daily living, see your healthcare professional or mental health professional. Exercise and physical activity are great ways to ease symptoms of depression or anxiety, but they don't replace talk therapy, sometimes called psychotherapy, or medicines.
